Data Science Stack documentation
================================

Data Science Stack (DSS) is a ready-to-run environment for Machine Learning (ML) and data science.  
It's built on open-source tooling, including Canonical K8s, JupyterLab, and MLflow, and is usable on any Ubuntu/Snap-enabled workstation.

DSS provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) for managing containerised ML environment images such as PyTorch or TensorFlow, on top of Canonical K8s.

Typically, creating ML environments on a workstation involves complex and hard-to-reverse configurations. 
DSS solves this problem by providing accessible, production-ready, isolated, and reproducible ML environments that fully utilise a workstation's GPUs.

Both ML beginners and engineers who need to build complex development and runtime environments will see set-up time reduced to a minimum, 
allowing them to get started with meaningful work within minutes.
