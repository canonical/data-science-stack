Data Science Stack
==================

Data science stack (DSS) is a ready-to-run environment for machine learning
and data science.  It’s built on open-source tooling (including MicroK8s,
JupyterLab and MLFlow) and usable on any Ubuntu/Snap-enabled workstation.

DSS provides a CLI for managing containerised ML environments images such as
PyTorch or TensorFlow, on top of MicroK8s.

Typically, creating ML environments on a workstation involves complex and
hard-to-reverse configuration. DSS solves this problem by making accessible,
production-ready, isolated and reproducible ML environments, that make full
use of a workstation’s GPUs.

Both ML beginners and engineers who need to build complex development and
runtime environments will see set-up time reduced to a minimum, allowing
them to get on with useful work within minutes.
